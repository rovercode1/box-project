This was made to be a part of a fashion/clothing website on a separate project.

The first version was unnecessarily long.
The second version cuts down a LOT of code.

#Version 1 
  #Had too much code
  #Used if/else statments for different colours

#Version 2
  #Used objects to clean up code.
  #One line of code to change all colours
